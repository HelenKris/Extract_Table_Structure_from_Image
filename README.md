In this notebook we will solve an applied problem that can be found in any organization - transferring tabular data from an image directly to an Excel file while maintaining the original table structure. We will use PaddleOC. Start the laptop in the collab by first placing the image in the collab /content folder and specifying its correct name in the image_name variable in str format.
